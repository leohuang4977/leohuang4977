## Hi there, welcome to Leo Huang's Repos 

ðŸŽ“ I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Toronto studying people's social networks and human interactions with AI chatbots. 

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in analysis and prediction related to product analytics and user experiences. My work typically focuses on A/B (hypothesis) testing, predictive analytics, reporting & insights, and defining new metrics. The tools I primarily use are Python, R, SQL, Tableau, and Adobe Analytics.  

ðŸ“« How to reach me: Email me at leo.huang4977@gmail.com! 

âš¡ Fun fact: I'm the proud caretaker of a 3-meter tall birds of paradise plant ðŸŒ¿
